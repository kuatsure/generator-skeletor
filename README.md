### Yeoman Generators

This one is a basic skeleton for a project ... Yeoman asks if you the project name, what scripting language you'll like, what style preprocessor you want, also any sort of markup language / templating you want.

To install generator-skeletor from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-skeletor
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
$ yo skeletor
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
