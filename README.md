### Yeoman Generators

A bare bones generator for Yeoman ... Yeoman asks you the project name, what scripting language you'll like and what style preprocessor you want. That's it!

To install generator-skeletor from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-skeletor
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
$ yo skeletor
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
